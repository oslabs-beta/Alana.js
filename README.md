## About alanajs

alanajs is an all-in-one tool that simplifies AWS SDK from development to production  Make setting up Lambda microservices easier than ever. Designed specifically for the Node.js runtime environment, Alana.js consolidates functionality provided by AWS SDK and AWS Console so that you can automate your deployment and configuration tasks and focus on writing code. Create Lambda functions with layers and dependencies, build on API Gateway, and invoke functions locally â€” all with one simple installation. Here is a [medium]**insert link** article describing the story behind alanajs.
You can also visit us [here]**insert demo link**.

## Getting Started

This section describes the instructions for end users who would like to download the package and connect their AWS account. For developers who would like to contribute to the open-source project, follow these [instructions](#enhancement and improvements).

### Installation and Setup

1. Install alanajs as a package dependency.

   ```sh
   npm install alanajs
   ```

   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
   AWS_REGION=
   ROLENAME=
   S3BUCKETNAME=
   AWS_ACCOUNT=
   ```

3. Run the follow through the command line to update .env file or create one if it does not exist. Replace the parameters with user's details. Refer to **insert demo link documentation here** for more details.

   ```sh
   alanajs init <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> [AWS_ACCOUNT] [AWS_REGION] -r [ROLENAME] -b [S3BUCKETNAME]
   ```

4. Create a LambdaFunctions directory to store directories and files to add as Lambda functions.

5. Import the package to start using alana methods.

   ```sh
   import 'alana' from 'alanajs';
   ```

6. That's it! You are ready to start running code through the command line or by running node [fileName] to execute the functions.
